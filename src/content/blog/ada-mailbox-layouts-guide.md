ADA compliance is one of the most common reasons mailbox projects fail inspection. The mistakes are often small, but they are expensive to correct after installation. Use this guide to avoid rework and keep projects on track.

If you are planning a new layout, start with [ADA-compliant installs](/services/ada-compliant-installs/) and confirm coverage in [San Diego](/service-areas/san-diego/).

## Who this guide is for
- Property managers planning mailbox upgrades.
- HOA boards reviewing compliance risks.
- Contractors preparing site layouts.

## 1) Reach range errors
Mailbox compartments must stay within allowable reach ranges. This is the most common inspection issue.

**What to verify**
- Final door heights for both standard and parcel compartments.
- Hardware placement and door swing clearance.
- Consistency across the full mailbox bank.

## 2) Incorrect slope or transitions
Even a compliant mailbox height can fail if the approach surface is uneven or steep.

**What to check**
- Surface transitions at pads or walkways.
- Any lip or curb that limits access.
- Drainage that causes pooling at the approach path.

## 3) Approach clearance constraints
If residents cannot approach the mailbox safely, the installation can fail ADA review.

**Key clearance factors**
- Stable, slip-resistant surface.
- Adequate maneuvering space.
- Clear path without obstructions.

## 4) Mailroom circulation issues
Indoor mailrooms have their own constraints. If the aisle is too narrow or the turning radius is tight, the layout can fail ADA review.

**Mailroom checks**
- Clear aisle widths for turning.
- Door clearance and swing.
- No obstructions from package carts or benches.

## 5) Placement without USPS coordination
Even if ADA is correct, USPS still needs to confirm access and placement for delivery.

**USPS coordination tips**
- Review the layout before fabrication.
- Confirm access routes for carriers.
- Document the approved location.

## 6) Not planning for resident access
Mailboxes should be easy to find and easy to use.

**Resident-focused checklist**
- Lighting and visibility.
- Clear walkway width.
- Safe access in early morning or evening hours.

## 7) Documentation and pre-install review
Most issues are easy to fix if caught early. A documented review helps avoid rework.

**Documentation to keep**
- Final layout drawings or marked photos.
- ADA checklist used during site review.
- USPS approval notes or confirmation.

## 8) Missing a compliance review before install
Most issues are easy to fix if caught early.

**Best practice**
Conduct a layout review with an installer who understands USPS and ADA requirements before any pad work or mounting begins.

## ADA review checklist
Use this checklist to verify compliance before installation.

- Verify reach ranges and heights.
- Confirm approach clearance and maneuvering space.
- Check surface slopes and transitions.
- Confirm mailbox labels and visibility.

## Common mistakes to avoid
- Assuming the existing pad is compliant without measurements.
- Mounting at heights that vary across the bank.
- Skipping USPS review when relocating equipment.

## FAQ
**Do ADA rules apply to mailbox replacements?**
Yes. Retrofits still need to meet ADA access and reach requirements.

**Can we install ADA-compliant mailboxes inside a mailroom?**
Yes, as long as the approach route and clearances meet ADA standards.

**Does USPS require ADA compliance checks?**
USPS approval does not replace ADA compliance. Both must be met.
