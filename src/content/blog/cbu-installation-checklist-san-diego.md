A Cluster Box Unit (CBU) installation is a compliance project as much as it is a construction project. In San Diego, most HOA boards and property managers need a predictable plan that covers USPS coordination, site layout, ADA access, and resident communication. This guide is a comprehensive checklist you can use in board meetings and project planning.

If you are just getting started, review the [CBU installation service](/services/cbu-installation/) and confirm coverage for [San Diego](/service-areas/san-diego/).

## Who this guide is for
- HOA boards replacing outdated or damaged mailbox banks.
- Property managers planning a new CBU install.
- Builders and contractors coordinating USPS approval.

## Key terms to align on
- **CBU**: A centralized mailbox bank with USPS delivery access.
- **USPS approval**: Required confirmation for placement and access.
- **ADA compliance**: Reach range and approach clearance requirements.

## Quick summary for board members
- USPS approval is required before installation.
- ADA reach and approach clearances must be verified at the site.
- The project scope should include pads, anchors, layout, and USPS sign-off.

## Phase 1: Scope definition and project goals
Start by defining the problem you are solving and what success looks like. When the scope is clear, approvals and construction move faster.

**Questions to answer**
- Are you replacing damaged mailboxes or adding new capacity?
- Do you need parcel lockers now, or is the focus on letter compartments?
- Is this a single site or multiple clusters across a large property?

**Deliverables to document**
- Mailbox type and compartment counts.
- Existing equipment condition (photos help).
- Proposed locations and access routes.

## Phase 2: USPS coordination and approval
USPS approval is not optional. It should happen before fabrication or construction.

**USPS coordination checklist**
- Schedule a site visit with a USPS-approved installer.
- Document the proposed location and carrier access route.
- Confirm if the carrier needs a new or updated delivery path.
- Keep written notes or approvals for your records.

## Phase 3: ADA and accessibility verification
ADA compliance is the most common reason mailbox projects fail inspection. Confirm compliance early.

**ADA details to verify**
- Reach range for all compartments, including parcel lockers.
- Clear, stable approach and adequate maneuvering space.
- Surface slope, path width, and doorway clearance (if inside a mailroom).

If you need a deeper review, see [ADA-compliant installs](/services/ada-compliant-installs/).

## Phase 4: Site selection and layout
The location must satisfy USPS access, resident convenience, and HOA design standards.

**Site selection criteria**
- Visibility and lighting.
- Clear access for delivery vehicles.
- Safe resident access at all times of day.

**Layout checklist**
- Confirm mailbox orientation and swing clearance.
- Verify setbacks from curbs or landscaping.
- Identify underground utilities before pad work.

## Site walk checklist for board members
Bring this list to the site visit so the board can document decisions.

**Checklist**
- Walk the carrier approach route and note obstructions.
- Confirm lighting and visibility at early delivery hours.
- Record distance from parking or primary resident paths.
- Photograph surface conditions and drainage.
- Note any landscaping or irrigation that could interfere with the pad.

## Phase 5: Construction scope and pad work
A durable foundation prevents long-term alignment and security issues.

**Pad and anchor checklist**
- Pad size and depth defined in the scope.
- Reinforcement and drainage confirmed.
- Anchors aligned to manufacturer requirements.

**Construction tasks to include**
- Demolition or removal of existing equipment.
- Concrete pour and cure time.
- Final mounting and leveling.

## Phase 6: Procurement and lead times
CBU lead times vary. Order timing should align with approvals and site readiness.

**Procurement checklist**
- Manufacturer and model confirmation.
- Finish and keying requirements.
- Delivery schedule coordinated with installation window.

## Phase 7: Resident communication and access planning
Most HOA friction happens because residents are surprised. A simple communication plan avoids that.

**Resident notice plan**
- Work schedule and duration.
- Any temporary mailbox access changes.
- Key distribution plan after installation.

**Sample resident notice (short form)**
- Date and time of work window.
- Any temporary access changes.
- Contact for questions.

## Phase 8: Inspection, sign-off, and handoff
The goal is a clean USPS inspection and a smooth handoff to property management.

**Handoff checklist**
- USPS sign-off documented.
- Keys delivered to property management.
- Final punch list completed.

## Budget and scope line items to expect
While every project is different, these are common cost drivers:
- Site demo and removal.
- Concrete pad and anchorage.
- CBU equipment and hardware.
- USPS coordination and inspection.
- Tenant notices and key distribution.

## Repair vs replace decision check
Some boards are unsure if they should repair existing units or replace them with CBUs.

**Repair may be reasonable if**
- Damage is isolated to a few doors or locks.
- The current layout is USPS compliant.
- Access and ADA clearance still meet requirements.

**Replacement is usually better if**
- Multiple boxes are damaged or corroded.
- The layout no longer meets USPS or ADA standards.
- You need additional parcel capacity or compartments.

If you are unsure, review [repairs and lock changes](/services/repairs-lock-changes/) versus [mailbox replacement and retrofits](/services/mailbox-replacement-retrofits/).

## Risk register: common failure points
Use this list to spot issues early.

**High risk**
- USPS approval not documented.
- ADA reach range not verified.
- No clear access route for carriers.

**Moderate risk**
- Lighting or visibility is poor.
- Drainage or surface slope affects access.
- Resident notice plan is unclear.

## Board-ready documentation pack
Prepare a simple project file so future board members can verify compliance.

**Documents to keep**
- USPS approval notes or confirmation.
- Final layout and site photos.
- Contractor scope of work.
- Inspection sign-off and key distribution record.

## Sample timeline (adjust as needed)
- Week 1: Site visit and USPS review.
- Week 2: Final layout and scope approval.
- Week 3: Pad work and site preparation.
- Week 4: CBU installation and USPS sign-off.

## Post-install maintenance plan
Even new CBUs need a simple maintenance routine.

**Best practice checklist**
- Inspect doors and locks seasonally for wear.
- Confirm labels remain legible and secure.
- Re-check pad alignment after heavy weather.
- Document any repeated vandalism or forced entry.

## San Diego-specific considerations
San Diego properties often deal with coastal corrosion, mixed-use site constraints, and rising package volume. Plan for long-term durability and growth by considering parcel locker capacity even if your immediate need is only letter compartments.

## Frequently asked questions
**How long does a CBU installation take in San Diego?**
Timeline depends on USPS review and site readiness. Most projects include a site visit, approval, pad work, installation, and final sign-off.

**Do we need USPS approval if we keep the same location?**
Yes. USPS typically requires approval for the mailbox type, location, and access route.

**Can we add parcel lockers later?**
Yes, but it is often more cost-effective to plan for lockers during the initial installation if package volume is growing.
