Mailbox systems fail gradually. Locks stick, doors warp, and corrosion spreads. The core decision for most San Diego properties is whether to repair or replace. This guide provides a practical framework you can use to choose the right path and avoid costly rework.

If you are in San Diego, start with the [mailbox services overview](/services/) and confirm coverage at the [San Diego service area page](/service-areas/san-diego/).

## Who this guide is for
- HOA boards evaluating mailbox budgets.
- Property managers dealing with recurring repairs.
- Owners planning a full site upgrade.

## Start with the condition assessment
A clear condition review tells you whether a repair will last.

**Signs repair is likely sufficient**
- Damage is limited to a few doors or locks.
- The main housing is structurally sound.
- The system meets USPS and ADA requirements.

If you are dealing with isolated issues, start with [repairs and lock changes](/services/repairs-lock-changes/).

**Signs replacement is the better investment**
- Widespread corrosion or vandalism.
- Outdated mailbox dimensions or layout.
- Non-compliant access or height issues.

For full system upgrades, see [mailbox replacement and retrofits](/services/mailbox-replacement-retrofits/).

## Inspection and compliance risk
Even if a repair is technically possible, an outdated system may fail USPS or ADA review.

**Compliance checkpoints**
- Reach range and approach clearance.
- Secure access and compartment integrity.
- Updated mailbox standards.

If you are unsure, review [ADA-compliant installs](/services/ada-compliant-installs/).

## Decision matrix (repair vs replacement)
Use this quick matrix to guide the board discussion.

**Repair is favored when**
- Damage is localized and not systemic.
- USPS and ADA compliance is confirmed.
- The system still meets capacity needs.

**Replacement is favored when**
- Multiple issues are present across the bank.
- The layout no longer meets USPS access expectations.
- The property needs more compartments or parcel capacity.

## Long-term cost considerations
Repairs can be cost-effective, but repeated repairs add up. Replacement often improves reliability, reduces future maintenance, and supports long-term compliance.

**Cost drivers to compare**
- Labor for repeated lock or door replacements.
- Ongoing vandalism or corrosion exposure.
- Need for new pads, anchors, or layout changes.

## Pre-bid checklist for boards
Use this checklist to keep vendor proposals comparable.

**Checklist**
- Written scope with repair or replacement recommendation.
- USPS coordination included.
- ADA compliance review included.
- Timeline and resident communication plan.

## San Diego-specific factors
Coastal communities face accelerated corrosion. Inland communities often deal with older boxes that no longer match USPS expectations. A replacement can reduce repeat repairs and improve long-term reliability.

## Example scenarios
**Scenario 1: Isolated vandalism**
If only a few doors or locks are damaged, targeted repairs are often appropriate.

**Scenario 2: Aging equipment**
If a large percentage of doors are corroded or warped, replacement is often the more stable solution.

**Scenario 3: Compliance update**
If USPS or ADA requirements are not met, replacement is usually required to pass inspection.

## Sample timeline comparison
**Repair path**
Site review, parts order, targeted repair, and final verification.

**Replacement path**
Site review, USPS layout approval, pad work, installation, and sign-off.

## FAQ
**Can we replace only part of a mailbox bank?**
Sometimes, but mismatched systems can create access and compliance issues. A site visit clarifies the best path.

**Will USPS require a new layout for replacement?**
Often yes. USPS generally needs to approve the new system type and placement.

**How long does a replacement take?**
Timeline depends on layout approval, site readiness, and delivery of the new units.

## Next steps
If your property is in San Diego, request a review and compare options. Start with [repairs and lock changes](/services/repairs-lock-changes/) for isolated issues or [mailbox replacement and retrofits](/services/mailbox-replacement-retrofits/) for full upgrades.
