    "p1": "In Carlsbad, mailbox projects are often driven by growing master-planned communities, aging equipment in established neighborhoods, and the need to meet current USPS and ADA expectations. Postal Systems installs and replaces commercial mailbox systems for coastal HOAs, apartments, and business parks throughout Carlsbad.",
    "p2": "We handle the full scope for Carlsbad properties: evaluating your current setup, planning USPS-compliant layouts, providing equipment options, installing concrete pads and anchors, and coordinating USPS inspection and sign-off so boards and managers have one accountable contractor."

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Can you help our Carlsbad HOA replace aging mailboxes while staying compliant with USPS?",
      "answer": "Yes. For Carlsbad communities, we review your current mailbox locations, equipment, and any USPS notices you have received. We then recommend CBU or 4C solutions that meet current USPS standards, coordinate layout approval, and complete installation and inspection sign-off."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can parcel lockers be added to our existing Carlsbad mailbox stations?",
      "answer": "In many cases, yes. We look at available space, USPS requirements, and resident access to determine where parcel lockers can be added. For Carlsbad properties, we design a layout that supports modern package volume while keeping mail routes efficient for USPS."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much disruption should we expect during a mailbox project in Carlsbad?",
      "answer": "We plan Carlsbad projects so boards and managers know exactly when equipment will be removed and installed, how long USPS access will be affected, and when residents receive keys. Many projects are staged so the transition happens within a tight, well-communicated window."
