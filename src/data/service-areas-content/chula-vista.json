    "p1": "In Chula Vista, many mailbox projects start when HOAs, townhome communities, or apartments receive USPS letters about deteriorating equipment or outdated layouts. Postal Systems installs and replaces commercial mailbox systems across Eastlake, Otay Ranch, and established neighborhoods throughout Chula Vista.",
    "p2": "We manage the full scope for Chula Vista properties: layout and equipment selection, concrete pads and anchors, USPS coordination, inspection sign-off, and resident communication so changeovers are predictable and well-documented for boards and managers."

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Do we need USPS approval before replacing mailboxes at our Chula Vista property?",
      "answer": "Yes. USPS needs to review the proposed mailbox type, location, and access before work begins. For Chula Vista projects, Postal Systems coordinates directly with the local USPS contacts so layouts, equipment, and final locations meet current standards before installation and inspection."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you upgrade our Chula Vista community to CBUs or 4C mailboxes while keeping a similar look?",
      "answer": "Often we can modernize equipment while still staying close to the appearance and layout your residents are used to. We review site photos and existing boxes, then recommend USPS-approved CBU or 4C options that balance aesthetics, reliability, and long-term durability for your Chula Vista property."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you handle resident notices and access during mailbox work in Chula Vista?",
      "answer": "For Chula Vista HOAs and apartments, we coordinate a clear schedule, tenant notices, temporary mail access if needed, and USPS timing so downtime is minimized. Once USPS has inspected and approved the installation, we turn keys and information back over to management for distribution."
