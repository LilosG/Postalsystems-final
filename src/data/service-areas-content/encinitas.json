  "intro": {
    "p1": "In Encinitas, mailbox projects often come from coastal weathering, older garden-style communities, and the need to modernize shared mail areas. Postal Systems installs and replaces commercial mailbox systems for HOAs, apartments, and mixed-use properties from Leucadia and downtown Encinitas to inland neighborhoods.",
    "p2": "We manage the full scope for Encinitas properties: reviewing your current mailbox layout, planning USPS-compliant replacements, installing pads and anchors, and coordinating USPS inspections so boards and managers have a single contractor accountable for the outcome."
  },
  "commonProjects": [
    "New cluster box units for HOAs and townhome communities near the Encinitas coastline and inland hills.",
    "4C wall-mounted mailrooms for small apartment buildings and mixed-use properties along main Encinitas corridors.",
    "Parcel locker additions where online shopping has outgrown traditional mailboxes.",
    "Mailbox replacements at older Encinitas communities where existing equipment is corroded, leaking, or frequently vandalized.",
    "Upgrades to mailbox locations to better support ADA reach, height, and approach clearances."

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Can you replace aging mailboxes at our Encinitas community without moving the location?",
      "answer": "Often we can keep existing general locations while upgrading to USPS-approved CBU or 4C equipment that meets current standards. For Encinitas projects, we evaluate clearances, access, and USPS feedback before confirming whether the existing location is appropriate or a new location is recommended."
    },
    {
      "question": "What types of mailbox systems are most common for Encinitas HOAs and apartments?",
      "answer": "Most Encinitas communities use CBUs or 4C wall-mounted mailboxes, often combined with parcel lockers for package volume. We review your property layout, resident needs, and USPS requirements to recommend the right configuration for your site."
    },
    {
      "question": "How involved does our Encinitas board or management team need to be during the project?",
      "answer": "We ask boards and managers to help with approvals and resident communication, and we handle the technical scope, USPS coordination, and installation details. Throughout an Encinitas project, we provide clear timelines so your team can keep residents informed without managing the construction itself."
