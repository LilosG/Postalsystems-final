    "p1": "In Escondido, mailbox projects are often triggered by older equipment at long-established communities, increased package volume, and the need to meet current USPS and ADA guidelines. Postal Systems installs and replaces commercial mailbox systems for HOAs, apartments, and business parks across Escondido.",
    "p2": "We handle the full scope for Escondido properties: evaluating existing mailbox locations, planning USPS-compliant layouts, providing equipment options, pouring concrete pads, setting anchors, and coordinating USPS inspection so boards and managers work with one accountable contractor."

    {
      "question": "Can you help our Escondido community replace aging mailboxes that residents are complaining about?",
      "answer": "Yes. For Escondido properties, we review your current mailbox equipment, locations, and any USPS notices or resident feedback you have received. We then recommend USPS-approved CBU or 4C solutions, coordinate layout review, and handle installation and inspection sign-off."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if our existing Escondido mailbox locations are not ideal for access or parking?",
      "answer": "As part of the site visit, we look at traffic, parking, lighting, and resident access. If a new location would better serve your Escondido community and USPS delivery, we provide layout options and work with you and USPS to finalize a compliant solution."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you keep residents informed during a mailbox project in Escondido?",
      "answer": "We provide boards and managers with a clear timeline, sample notices, and key milestones so residents know when work starts, how long mail will be affected, and when new keys will be distributed. Our goal is to keep Escondido projects predictable and well-communicated from start to finish."
