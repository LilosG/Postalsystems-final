    "p1": "In San Marcos, mailbox projects are often driven by newer master-planned communities, growing student and workforce housing, and the need to keep shared mail areas compliant with current USPS and ADA guidelines. Postal Systems installs and replaces commercial mailbox systems for HOAs, apartments, and mixed-use properties across San Marcos.",
    "p2": "We handle the full scope for San Marcos properties: reviewing your existing setup, planning USPS-compliant layouts, recommending equipment, installing concrete pads and anchors, and coordinating USPS inspection so boards and managers work with one accountable contractor from site visit through key handover."
