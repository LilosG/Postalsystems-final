  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Why is USPS requiring 4C wall-mounted mailboxes instead of older styles?",
      "answer": "USPS has moved to centralized, security-focused mailbox equipment for most new and replacement projects. 4C wall-mounted mailboxes are the current standard for many indoor and outdoor applications. They improve security, accessibility, and carrier efficiency compared to older wall boxes and individual door slots."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you add parcel lockers to an existing mail room without replacing everything?",
      "answer": "In some cases we can add compatible parcel lockers to an existing mail room, but if existing mail equipment is outdated or not 4C-compliant, USPS may require a full upgrade. We assess your space, review USPS guidance, and explain your options so you can plan the project with clear expectations."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much wall space is required for a 4C installation?",
      "answer": "Required wall space depends on the number of mail compartments, parcel lockers, and modules. During our site visit we measure the available area, identify any obstructions, and design a layout that fits your wall while meeting USPS and ADA clearances."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you work in an occupied building without major disruption?",
      "answer": "Yes. For active properties we coordinate staging areas, protection for finished surfaces, and installation windows that minimize disruption. We also help communicate schedule and temporary mail arrangements where needed so residents know what to expect."
