  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "What makes a mailbox installation ADA-compliant?",
      "answer": "ADA-compliant mailbox projects address several factors: approach routes and slopes, landing and maneuvering clearances, reach ranges for tenant and parcel compartments, and hardware that can be operated without tight grasping or twisting. We measure these items on site and design a layout that aligns with current accessibility guidance and USPS expectations."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do all of our mailboxes need to be ADA-compliant?",
      "answer": "In many communities, not every single compartment must meet the strictest reach-range criteria, but there must be accessible options and an overall layout that provides safe access. During our review we explain what level of modification is appropriate for your specific site and equipment."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can we modify existing mailboxes to become ADA-compliant or do they need to be replaced?",
      "answer": "Sometimes we can improve accessibility by adjusting heights, reconfiguring cabinets, or performing concrete and ramp work around existing mailboxes. In other cases, especially with very old or damaged equipment, replacement is the better long-term solution. We outline both options whenever possible."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will USPS approve ADA-driven layout changes?",
      "answer": "USPS is primarily concerned with safe carrier access and efficient routes, but those goals can usually be aligned with ADA requirements. We coordinate directly with USPS on layout changes so both accessibility and carrier needs are addressed in one plan."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you work with attorneys or accessibility consultants?",
      "answer": "Yes. On projects driven by legal or consultant findings, we review their reports, confirm field conditions, and propose a mailbox scope that responds directly to the issues they have identified. Clear documentation and communication are part of our standard process."
