  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Do we need USPS approval before installing new CBUs?",
      "answer": "Yes. USPS must review the proposed location, layout, and equipment type before new CBUs are installed. Postal Systems coordinates with USPS on your behalf so your project is approved and ready at inspection time."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you reuse existing pads and pedestals when replacing CBUs?",
      "answer": "Sometimes. If the existing pads and pedestals are in good condition and meet current size, anchoring, and accessibility requirements, we may be able to reuse them. During our site visit we inspect your existing setup and explain whether reuse or replacement is the better option."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much does CBU installation cost in San Diego County?",
      "answer": "Pricing depends on the number of CBU units, concrete pad work, demolition or relocation of existing equipment, ADA upgrades, and site access. The most accurate way to estimate cost is to share details about your property, current mail setup, and USPS notes so we can provide a written quote."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you phase the work so residents continue to receive mail?",
      "answer": "Yes. On many projects we phase installation so some CBUs remain active while new units are installed and inspected. We outline phasing options and any temporary mail arrangements in your proposal so residents know what to expect."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you help with vandalism-prone mail locations?",
      "answer": "Yes. We routinely replace vandalized or repeatedly damaged CBUs. We can recommend locations, lighting improvements, and configurations that improve visibility and reduce the likelihood of repeated damage, while still meeting USPS requirements."
