  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Do we need USPS approval before installing new cluster mailboxes?",
      "answer": "Yes. For commercial mailbox installations, USPS must review and approve your layout, equipment type, and final location. Postal Systems coordinates with USPS on your behalf so your project does not get delayed at inspection time."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you replace damaged mailboxes with the same style we already have?",
      "answer": "In many cases we can match existing equipment, but if your current mailboxes are outdated or no longer compliant, USPS may require newer, approved models. We assess your site, recommend options, and explain what USPS will accept so there are no surprises."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much does commercial mailbox installation cost in San Diego County?",
      "answer": "Pricing depends on the number of units, concrete pad work, demolition of old equipment, ADA upgrades, and site access. The fastest way to get accurate pricing is to share a few details about your property and USPS notes, and we will provide a written quote."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you handle ADA-compliant mailbox installations?",
      "answer": "Yes. We routinely design and install ADA-compliant mail stations, addressing reach, slope, and clearances. If your existing mailboxes have triggered accessibility concerns, we can upgrade the layout as part of your installation."
