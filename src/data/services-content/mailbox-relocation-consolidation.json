    {
      "question": "Can we relocate mailboxes without disrupting daily mail service?",
      "answer": "Most relocation and consolidation projects are phased so residents continue receiving mail while new locations are prepared. We coordinate with USPS to align installation, inspection, and turnover so downtime is minimized and clearly communicated."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does USPS have to approve new mailbox locations?",
      "answer": "Yes. USPS must review and approve new mailbox locations and layouts, especially when routes are changing or stations are consolidated. We handle that coordination directly and design locations with carrier safety and efficiency in mind."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can relocation help reduce theft or vandalism?",
      "answer": "Relocating mailboxes to well-lit, visible areas and consolidating into central clusters often reduces theft and vandalism risk. We look at lighting, sight lines, and resident traffic patterns when recommending new locations."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you handle concrete pads and pedestal work for new locations?",
      "answer": "Yes. We typically handle pad work, pedestals, and equipment as a single scope so foundations and hardware are built to support the relocated mailboxes and meet manufacturer and USPS guidance."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can we combine relocation with upgrading our mailbox equipment?",
      "answer": "Relocation and consolidation projects are often the best time to upgrade aging equipment. We can combine new locations with new CBUs, 4C cabinets, and parcel lockers so you address both placement and hardware in a single project."
