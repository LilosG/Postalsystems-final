  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "How do I know if our mailboxes should be replaced instead of repaired?",
      "answer": "If you are seeing recurring lock failures, visible rust and corrosion, damaged doors, or USPS concerns about security, it is usually more cost-effective to plan a replacement or retrofit. During our visit we assess the condition of your equipment and outline both repair and replacement paths so you can make an informed decision."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you match the look of our existing mailboxes during a retrofit?",
      "answer": "In many cases we can choose finishes and models that complement your existing architecture and color schemes. When an exact match is not possible, we propose options that modernize the look while still fitting the property’s style and budget."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will residents lose access to mail during a replacement project?",
      "answer": "We plan phasing and temporary solutions so residents can continue receiving mail wherever possible while demolition and installation take place. Our proposals include a clear explanation of how long each phase will impact access and how we coordinate with USPS."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you add parcel lockers while we replace existing mailboxes?",
      "answer": "Yes. Mailbox replacement and retrofits are often the ideal time to add parcel lockers and improve package handling. We design layouts that combine CBUs or 4C cabinets with parcel lockers in a way that works for both residents and carriers."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you handle both the concrete and the mailbox installation?",
      "answer": "On most projects we handle the pad, pedestal, and mailbox work as a single scope. That keeps responsibilities clear and helps ensure that foundations, hardware, and equipment all meet manufacturer and USPS requirements."
