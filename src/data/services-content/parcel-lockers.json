      "question": "Can you add parcel lockers to our existing CBUs or 4C mailboxes?",
      "answer": "Yes. In many cases we add parcel lockers alongside existing USPS-approved equipment so you do not have to replace your entire mail station. We design configurations that match your current hardware and meet USPS expectations."

    {
      "question": "Do you coordinate with USPS for parcel locker approvals and inspections?",
      "answer": "Yes. We communicate directly with USPS to review layouts, confirm equipment types, and schedule inspections so your project does not stall at sign-off."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many parcel lockers do we need for our property?",
      "answer": "Locker counts depend on the number of units, carrier volume, and how residents use online ordering. During the site visit we look at your package trends and recommend a locker bank size that fits your property."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you phase installation so residents still receive packages?",
      "answer": "On many projects we phase work or temporarily redirect deliveries so carriers always have a clear, approved place to leave packages while lockers are being installed and inspected."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do parcel lockers help reduce package theft?",
      "answer": "Secure parcel lockers are one of the most effective ways to cut down on theft. We design placement, lighting, and access around theft reduction so packages are not left in exposed, high-traffic areas."
