  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Can you change mailbox locks for an entire HOA or building at once?",
      "answer": "Yes. We regularly perform bulk lock and key changeouts for HOAs, condominiums, and apartment communities across San Diego County. We confirm counts in advance, phase the work to maintain mail access, and provide clear direction on how and when residents receive their new keys."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you coordinate with USPS for repair and lock change work?",
      "answer": "For most lock and repair projects, USPS primarily cares that equipment is secure, accessible, and properly labeled. When a repair project overlaps with layout changes, relocations, or more extensive upgrades, we coordinate with USPS to make sure there are no surprises at inspection."
    },
    {
      "question": "How fast can you respond to mailbox repair requests?",
      "answer": "Response time depends on workload and the size of the project, but we understand that broken or unsecured mailboxes are urgent. We prioritize repair and security issues and will let you know up front what the timeline looks like for site review and completion."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you repair older mailboxes or do they always need to be replaced?",
      "answer": "Many older CBUs and 4C mailboxes can be repaired cost-effectively, especially when cabinets are structurally sound. During our review we will tell you honestly whether a repair makes sense or if replacement is the better long-term choice based on security, compliance, and available parts."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you work with both managed communities and individual property owners?",
      "answer": "Yes. We primarily work with HOAs, property managers, and building owners, but we also assist smaller properties and individual owners when their mail equipment falls under a shared or centralized system."
